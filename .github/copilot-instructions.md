## Code Review Language
Always provide code review feedback and suggestions in Japanese.

## Code Review Focus Areas
When reviewing code, pay attention to:
- Is business logic properly separated from UI components?
- Are custom hooks being used effectively for state management?
- Is the single responsibility principle being followed?
- Are manager classes handling domain logic appropriately?
- Is error handling implemented correctly?
- Are React best practices being followed (proper useEffect dependencies, cleanup, etc.)?
